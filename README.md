Final Year Project<br />
Interpretation of Music Scoresheet to Generate Audio File<br />
Image Processing & Music Domain<br />

The goal of this project is to develop an image processing algorithm that takes a music scoresheet image as input and generates an audio file of the symphony represented by the scoresheet image as output.

Process Flow:<br />
Preprocessing - Binarization<br />
Segmentation - Hierarchical Decomposition<br />
Training & Recognition - Artificial Neural Network (SVD, PCA, Classification Tree)<br />
Playback - MIDI<br />

Project is being developed on MATLAB platform.
